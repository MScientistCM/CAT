1) This tool requires Java in order to run, you can download this here: https://java.com/en/download/

2) [optional]
Open config.txt and change the 'directory' value from "C:" to the location of your CM exe file - the tool will the show this directory when asking for your CM exe.  DO NOT edit the offset value unless you know what you're doing - see below.

3) Make sure you've got a backup of your CM exe file.

4) Open colours.txt, for each attribute value (on the left) you need to enter a colour (to the right of the '=').  You can use either hexadecimal RGB values, e.g. FF0000 (Red), or you can use a colour name from the file x11.txt.  You can see what these colours look like here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_color_names.  If you don't want to edit all colours, then you can remove lines from colours.txt - or add "//" at the start of a line.  [You can add / remove colours to x11.txt if you want, just make sure you keep the same format]

5) Double-click Run.bat, pick your exe and the new colours will be applied.

6) Done.

If the colours aren't applied, try moving you exe to a different location (e.g. your Desktop) as Windows might be protecting the file.

[For those that play versions other than 3.9.68 only]
If you've managed to apply coloured attributes to an earlier version of the game then the offset value in config.txt can be edited to allow this tool to change those colours - just change it to the offset 2 bytes before the colour value for the attribute value of 1.  The tool will just apply the colours to the location [offset + (attribute * 2)].
